# Card-Roulette
A fun card roulette game. Go to the live version [here](www.google.com).

### Description
This web application can be used as a fun way to decide who (unluckily) will pay at the table when you are out with your friends. Essentially, it's adapted from Russian Roulette, except instead of playing with your life, you instead play with your wallet :). I created it because I wanted to learn TypeScript and solidify my front-end development skills.
